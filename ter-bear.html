				<p>I started off this project by speaking with my client Terri about her need for the site and the content she would like it to hold. After talking to Terri I drew up a rough wireframe for the mobile site might look like and share it with her.</p>

				<p>In addition to the site Terri needed a logo for her pet sitting business. She watches dogs, cats and even horses when her clients are away. I wanted to include all the pets in her logo and to keep it simple and clean.</p>

			<div class="grid-5">
				<p>From there I move into sketch and work up a simple wireframe based on the content placement. I also created the icons in the service section with a simple style to showcase her abilities.</p>

				<p>After reviewing my more complex wireframe with Terri and getting her feed back I jump into sublime creating the working version of the site in html and css.</p>

				<p>From my conversations with Terri it was clear that a static site was not going to meet her needs. She wanted to post pictures of the pets she watches and write about them. She also wanted to have her customers be able to leave reviews. It was for this reason that decided to build her site on Wordpress by making a custom theme.</p>
